      "function": "trace deviation within repetition",
      "setup": "record or sample a gesture you've already used in another piece",
      "action": "replay it five times, each time changing only your distance to the sound (mic placement, gain staging, room perspective)",
      "prompt": "Which version feels closest to memory, and which feels closest to fact?",
      "note": "Document the differences as if describing soil strata - colour, density, residue. No adjectives of taste."
    },
    "MIRROR": {
      "function": "reveal unacknowledged emotion in the sound",
      "setup": "play your most recent unfinished mix quietly enough that you can hear your own breathing over it",
      "action": "every time you feel the urge to adjust something, pause and note the body region where the discomfort appears",
      "prompt": "What does this sound want from you that you keep declining?",
      "note": "do not fix the mix; sit with the transcription of sensations"

      "function": "somatic re-grounding through subtraction",
      "setup": "open a session that feels overworked or anxious",
      "action": "lower the overall volume until it nearly disappears. Keep listening for five minutes",
      "prompt": "If the track could rest, what would that rest sound like?",
      "note": "The goal is not completion but relief; save the session under a new name ending in '—enough'"

      "function": "disrupt over-familiar logic chains",
      "setup": "take a multitrack session and solo the least important or most forgotten stem",
      "action": "treat that soloed element as the new protagonist; rebuild accompaniment around it",
      "prompt": "The mistake got here first—can you keep up?",
      "note": "when done, delete the original master bus and replace it with this version's silence"

    "ORACLE": {
      "function": "reset orientation, open symbolic space",
      "setup": "light, stillness, a single continuous tone",
      "action": "write or speak one sentence beginning 'The vessel remembers…' and another 'The residue forgets…'",
      "prompt": "When their meanings cross, end the tone",
      "note": "archive the recording; mark it as a threshold session. Don't revisit it for seven days"

      "function": "establish ritual hygiene before the Work begins",
      "setup": "open an old session you never finished. Do not play it yet",
      "action": "consolidate all regions, remove empty tracks, rename files by function not by date",
      "prompt": "A clean vessel hears more clearly. What was hidden by clutter?",
      "note": "Save as a new version with today's date. The act of ordering is the first transformation"
